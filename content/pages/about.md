**Check my blog** for my last updates about my works, my life, things I like and activities I enjoy.
My git repo links are somewhere in this site, you can check there about my projects.
I will also post stuff in the blog section, trying to be as much regular as possible in terms of updates and news.
More to come every week (hopefully) so, stay tuned!

## Content

Content will vary. I like different things so I will write different stuff. Here a list of what I think will pop up. :)

1. Cybersecurity
2. Web Development
3. Photography
4. Society
5. Music
6. Movies

Thanks for stepping by!
