## and there it is...

Hi there! I got it! Finally.

This is my first post, just an introduction and a chance to say hello! I will try to share fun and useful news, topics and themes here. Even though I'm quite new to blogging, I'll do my best to create something nice.

I want to thank everyone will take some time to check it and give it a read.
I will update my twitter account every time a new post will be released so, don't forget to follow me at
[@DeadCip](https://twitter.com/DeadCip)

**SPOILER:** ðŸ˜Ž
I think I'll start by sharing a little template I made for anyone who wants to use it for their own personal site/page. I will post it soon so stay tuned and let me know if you like it!

**TIP:**
Find some time to listen again or for the first time:
Cure - Disintegration (1989) ðŸ’”

Peace.
