## Welcome back!

Hi there, and Merry XMas!<br />
When I decided to create a site to introduce myself I had a small personal challenge into my mind: to be able to create something attractive with as few lines of code as possible LOL. The result can be seen on my [github](https://github.com/DamBasement/vintage-tv) page and on my  [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/115362535/127001) page.<br />
It's nothing more than a nice and unpretentious showcase that wants to present the people who use it in a captivating and exciting way, especially for nostalgics like me who grew up between the 80's and 90's.<br />
The music you will hear was created *ad hoc* by a colleague of mine whom I continue to thank, using a modular analog synthesizer created with Arduino (but that's another story).
Feel free to download it, edit it and use it as your business card.<br />
This is my XMas present for you!

**SPOILER:** ðŸ˜Ž
Recently I passed my **CRTO** (Certified Red Team Operator) by Zero Point Security. I will share soon my review about the course material and exam.

**TIP:**
For these lovely XMas vacations there is nothing better than watching again, or for the first time:<br />
>American Psycho - 2000 ðŸª“

Peace.
