# Welcome back!

Today I want to talk about CRTO certification I recently achieved.

Googling for CRTO (the Certified Red Team Operator), there are dozens of reviews explaining the exam, the lab and the course offered by ZeroPoint Security and RastaMouse.
I really do not want to reinvent the wheel for the umpteenth time but instead, to propose an approach that I have hardly found out there and which is working in my case, hoping this can be useful or encouraging for you too!

Prior to enrolling in it I had heard about this course from a work colleague and luckily it came when I most needed it. In fact, my journey started studying OSCP.
At a certain point, I realized that Active Directory obstacle in the new exam, effective from 2022, would be too difficult for me to overcome. So? I felt stuck, and I had to find a way to study this topic before approaching OSCP again.

Yes, I took this certification **WITHOUT** having my OSCP and I think this path could be useful for those who want to take both. Let me tell you why.
In fact, even if the difficulty of the CRTO is undoubted, especially for those who face Active Directory from scratch, still it remains a certification for beginners, with 2 main advantages in my opinion compared to OSCP.
## First, **the scope**.
CRTO is limited in scope to __Active Directory__ and __Cobalt Strike__. A nice advantage I would say compared to the sea of arguments that are required to pass OSCP.
I think there is a lot of confusion as to whether OSCP should be considered the first one just because it doesn't go as deep into AD topic as CRTO does.
Well, I guess that's just why one should focus on this certification **as his first one**. Isn't it easier to study one thing deeply than to study many?

Maybe I will say something unpopular here, but I think there is a lot of hype around certain certifications and this thing doesn't help people who want to take it.
Instead, it puts them in a hurry, makes them think they have to break their backs to get it (and in part this can be true, but let's not exaggerate!) and mostly, it generates a particular disappointment in not being able to obtain it.
Just think about it, so many certifications could help you explore topics in great depth and become an expert about them. At that point, those certifications that seem unattainable will really be more affordable and will leave something more indelible within us both as knowledge and as experience. They will still remains challenging of course, but definitely more enjoyable.

I think these things are valid not because most of us are stupid or because certain certifications are an insurmountable monster but simply because the target of those who undertake these paths is usually that of those who already work or have a family for example. In this case **ANY** certification becomes difficult, and those that are already particularly difficult obviously become impossible.
By impossible here I mean the concept of getting used to the idea of failing the exam on the first try. I mean, an exam can always go wrong, it's clear, but if I could get back the time I had when I was in university or even worse in high school to dedicate myself to certifications, well I certainly wouldn't be as anxious as I am now about them.

So, let's frame ourselves well. Most of us are workers, a large number of us have family, so we have to hold on to something else, certainly not time :)
Well in this case we are lucky. What do hackers and infosec experts have in common? Curiosity, and desire to learn. Having said that, I believe that what I said before takes on even more value and therefore I want to repeat it.

### Letâ€™s study one thing well, deeply and then move on.

When you're faced with a soup of stuff, make sure you're an expert on most of the things that go into that soup. If this means deferring some certifications, do it and focus on the topic, not the badge.
**CRTO lets you doing it about Active Directory concepts.**
Just keep in mind this.

## Second reason, Exam time.

The most important in my experience. I found it brutal for me and in the case of CRTO you have 48 hours spread over 4 days so it means approximately 12 hours per day if you want to take rest, eat, take a walk or whatever.
Well, having said that, if I have learned one thing from this exam it is that I am not at all ready to face an exam where I only have 24 hours available, and I think most of us share the same problem. This is the reason why you hear a lot of time that in some certification the first attempt went wrong. Are you considering the idea that working with this rush is not ok for you AT THIS TIME? You need to train it too, as everything.
Working for 4 days certainly tired me out, but it gave me the opportunity to reflect a lot and unblock myself in moments of stalemate. Look at the graph of my flags. I took a whole day to get the fourth flag.
This is a skill to train, not a natural skill. How do you train it? Spending time in the lab and experimenting. Do we all have this time? No, for the reasons mentioned above. Therefore? so it pays to become an expert. Experts on what? On how to do priv-esc in a linux environment, how to do it in a windows environment. Expert about Active Directory. They are all different world. In this way everything becomes easier.<br />

I am currently studying OSCP and will continue to do so according to my schedule. I'm pretty confident that the moment I feel ready will come soon, but certifications like the CRTO are very helpful, interesting, and they should fearlessly be considered a first choice in the learning path of someone working in infosec. For the record, at the time I started the certification I had 0 active directory background but rather experience on linux systems and some programming languages (off topic for CRTO)

For any other information, I don't think there is much to say unfortunately, apart from the information you find on the Zeropoint security site. I mean, take the lab time.
You're told it is 40 hours and that's a generous offer you will hear in pretty every review. It is in objective terms, 40 hours are not few, but they can be for you. For example, I had to buy 15 more than the 40 you are given in the course.
This is to say that we are all different and reviews sometimes don't help because we think too much about what others experienced. Instead, each test is unique and unrepeatable. Forget everything, don't think about anything except learning a concept well. This must be your mantra :) no one else.

This review is just my 2 cents and is not meant to discredit anyone, BUT it is meant to destroy false myths and cemented ideas. It doesn't matter what comes first or what comes after. Learn to become good. Slowly and well.
