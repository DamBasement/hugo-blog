Today I want to talk about CRTO certification I recently achieved.
Googling for CRTO (Certified Red Team Operator), there are dozens of reviews explaining the exam, the lab and the course offered by ZeroPoint Security and RastaMouse. I really do not want to reinvent the wheel for the umpteenth time but instead, to propose an approach that I have hardly found out there and which is working in my case, hoping this can be useful or encouraging for you too!</description></item><item><title>Vintage TV</title><link>https://dambasement.net/posts/26-12-2022-television/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dambasement.net/posts/26-12-2022-television/</guid><description>Welcome back! Hi there, and Merry XMas!
When I decided to create a site to introduce myself I had a small personal challenge into my mind: to be able to create something attractive with as few lines of code as possible LOL. The result can be seen on my github page and on my Behance page.
It&amp;rsquo;s nothing more than a nice and unpretentious showcase that wants to present the people who use it in a captivating and exciting way, especially for nostalgics like me who grew up between the 80&amp;rsquo;s and 90&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item><item><title>Greetings</title><link>https://dambasement.net/posts/11-12-2022-greetings/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dambasement.net/posts/11-12-2022-greetings/</guid><description>and there it is&amp;hellip; Hi there!
